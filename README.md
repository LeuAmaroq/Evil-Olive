# Evil-Olive

This was first a group project, where I took on all of the development except for the sound managing. I then revamp the project for my thesis in order to play-test it.

Especially fun for me was working on the mirror reflection power as I wanted the interaction to work with every mirror, in order to be able to later make more levels.
